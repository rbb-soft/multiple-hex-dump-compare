# Multiple Hex Dump Compare

It is an app that can compare multiple files and show the differences.

I did it because I did not find anything similar on the web, I only found 2 files compare.

I hope you find it as useful as it was for me.

# clone
``` git clone https://github.com/rbb-soft/multiple-hex-dump-compare

# add dependencies
npm install

# test

npm test

# build

npm run dist
